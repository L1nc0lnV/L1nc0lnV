### Hello friends

I write code to integrate diverse systems & platforms, work with data at scale, and developer toolkits. I also manage a very talented group of developers at [Butler/Till Media Services](https://butlertill.com/), working to improve martech and interfacing with Social Media & Google. I teach/facilitate courses at Boston University & St. John Fisher College in areas such as data design and management, and cyber security. 

My spare time is devoted to leveraging tech to improve health outcomes of people growing up or around Superfund sites, teaching disadvantaged groups how to work with tehcnology to elevate themselves and their families, and supporting veterans causes.

ðŸ¥‚ Cheers!
